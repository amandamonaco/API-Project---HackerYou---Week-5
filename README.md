#API Project - HackerYou - Week 5

This app uses Yummly's API to pull pineapple specific recipes.

By clicking on the bouncing pineapple, the user is directed to choose from a selection of various pineapple-type recipes. Once a choice is made, the user is given 12 recipes from Yummly to choose from. By clicking on the recipe itself, the user is directed to the actual recipe site on Yummly.
